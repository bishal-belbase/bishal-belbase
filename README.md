### Hi 👋

I believe that everyone, regardless of their background, 
should have the opportunity to pursue their dreams.

Regrettably, in many underserved communities, limited access to 
🩺 quality healthcare and 
📖 education is a significant obstacle, 
that prevents individuals from realizing their full potential.

Therefore, I am committed to being a part of something that changes this and 
contributing to building systems that empower everyone to dream big and live their dreams.
